"""

A basic flute or ney.

The embouchure hole is not modelled.

To use the design produced:
- make a flute without finger holes, just embouchure hole and end stopper.
- trim so that bottom note is in tune.
- drill finger holes.

The flute is a simple cylinder, so the tuning is not perfect over the two registers unless the finger holes are very large.
